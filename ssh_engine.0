SSH_ENGINE(5)               BSD File Formats Manual              SSH_ENGINE(5)

NAME
     ssh_engine -- OpenSSH engine configuration file

SYNOPSIS
     ~/.ssh/engine

DESCRIPTION
     ssh(1) obtains additional openssl(1) engine post initialization configu-
     ration from the following source:

           1.   user's configuration file (~/.ssh/engine)

     The configuration files contain sections separated by ``Engine'' specifi-
     cation, and each section is applied only for engine that match name given
     in specification.  Each engine command is executed immediately after
     parsing of line.

     The configuration file has the following format:

     Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are comments.  Otherwise a line
     is of the format ``command argument''.  Commands may be separated by
     whitespace or optional whitespace and exactly one '='.  Argument may
     optionally be enclosed in double quotes (") in order to represent command
     argument containing spaces.

     Engine  Restricts the following declarations (up to the next Engine key-
             word) to be only for engine that match name given after the key-
             word

     [Command]
             Specific to engine 'control commands'.  Use openssl(1) engine -vv
             command to list supported control commands with desctription.

FILES
     ~/.ssh/engine
             This is the per-user openssl(1) engine configuration file.  The
             format of this file is described above.  This file is used by the
             SSH client.  Because of the potential for abuse, this file must
             have strict permissions: read/write for the user, and not acces-
             sible by others.

EXAMPLES
     An example OpenSSH engine configuration file:

        # Comments allowed at start of line
        Engine e_nss
        CONFIG_DIR /home/sample/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.default/
        # Above command specifies the NSS config directory.
        # Refer to mozilla.org documentation how to find you profile directoty.
